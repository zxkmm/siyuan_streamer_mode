Streamer Mode: Avoiding the Leakage of Sensitive Information During Live Streaming

# What is Streamer Mode?
Streamer Mode is a special feature provided by some software, particularly gaming and live streaming applications, designed to protect users' privacy and security during live streaming or video recording. When Streamer Mode is activated, the software automatically hides or blocks certain sensitive information, such as:

1. **Personal Information**: Usernames, email addresses, real names, etc.
2. **Notifications**: Pop-up notifications or messages from other applications to prevent private information from being leaked during live streaming.
3. **IP Address**: Prevents viewers from obtaining the streamer's IP address through the live stream, thereby preventing malicious attacks.
4. **Links**: Automatically blocks or blurs links that may contain sensitive information.

This allows streamers to focus on their content without worrying about privacy leaks or harassment, enhancing the security and privacy protection of live streaming.
