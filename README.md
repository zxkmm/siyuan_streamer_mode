Streamer Mode: Avoiding the Leakage of Sensitive Information During Live Streaming

# What is Streamer Mode?
Streamer Mode is a special feature provided by some software, particularly gaming and live streaming applications, designed to protect users' privacy and security during live streaming or video recording. When Streamer Mode is activated, the software automatically hides or blocks certain sensitive information, such as:

1. **Personal Information**: Automatically blocks usernames, email addresses, real names that you had choosen.
2. **Passwords**: Automatically blocks passwords that you had choosen.
3. **IP Address**: Automatically blocks IPs that you had choosen.
4. **Links**: Automatically blocks links that you had choosen.

This allows streamers to focus on their content without worrying about privacy leaks or harassment, enhancing the security and privacy protection of live streaming.
